# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a simple neural network for the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" competition on Kaggle. The objective of this competition is to predict house prices based on different features.

## Notebook Description

The notebook is written in Python and utilizes the Keras machine learning library with the TensorFlow backend. The approach taken in this notebook is a basic neural network architecture designed to provide an introduction to solving the problem.

The notebook covers the following stages:

1. Data loading and exploration: An basic exploration of the data is conducted to understand the features and distribution of house prices.
2. Data preprocessing: Data cleaning and transformation are performed, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
3. Model building: A neural network with a simple architecture is defined and trained to make price predictions.
4. Model evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like root mean squared error (MSE), and the results are compared.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* The following Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.
